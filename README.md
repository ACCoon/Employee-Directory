# Employee Directory
A basic employee directory application powered by React, which allows the user to view a list of employees and nonsensitive information. Typing in the given text box will also filter the list of employees by name. Clicking the Name table header will sort the list alphabetically in first ascending, then descending order.

Currently there is no clean styling implemented for this application; it is all function. Styling will be added in the future for a more polished appearance and user experience.
